## 🌸 About the Project

This is a **romantic single-page website** made for my love ❤️  
It features smooth transitions, glowing floating hearts, and gentle animations with a typing effect for each message.  
Built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and hosted using **GitHub Pages** so it can live forever online 💫

It’s also **fully responsive**, so it looks beautiful on both desktop and mobile screens 📱

## 💌 How It Works

Each “scene” or page of this website is defined inside the `script.js` file.  
You can easily add, remove, or edit messages without touching the rest of the code.

Here’s where you’ll find them:

```js
const messages = [
  { title: "Happy Anniversary, my love 💖", text: "Click next to begin our little journey together 💞" },
  { title: "From the moment I met you…", text: "I knew my world had just changed forever 🌷" },
  { title: "Every heartbeat whispers your name", text: "Your smile is my sunrise, your laugh my favorite melody ☀️" },
  { title: "You are my today and all my tomorrows", text: "Each moment with you is my happiest memory 💫" },
  { title: "Forever yours ❤️", text: "No matter where life takes us — my heart will always find you." }
];
✅ To add more:
Just add another { title: "...", text: "..." } inside the list.
The site automatically updates and adds more scenes.

When someone opens your repository, they’ll see this beautiful and meaningful README on the main page — both romantic 💘 and clear technically.  

Would you like me to make a **fancier version with emojis and subtle ASCII hearts** (like decorative borders or separators) to make it look even more special when viewed on GitHub?
